# Exo-Lab LLM Benchmarking Project

## Tasks

### Research
- [x] Research exo-lab clustering service architecture
- [x] Understand how LLMs are deployed within exo
- [x] Identify inference engines used (MLX, tinygrad)

### Setup Environment
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Clone exo repository
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Configure environment for benchmarking

### Identify Models for Testing
- [ ] List available LLM models in exo
- [ ] Select representative models for benchmarking
- [ ] Verify models can run on the same node

### Develop Benchmarking Methodology
- [ ] Define performance metrics (latency, throughput, memory usage)
- [ ] Create standardized test prompts
- [ ] Design methodology for consistent measurements
- [ ] Determine how to isolate model performance on same node

### Create Benchmarking Scripts
- [ ] Develop script to measure inference latency
- [ ] Develop script to measure throughput
- [ ] Develop script to measure memory usage
- [ ] Create utilities for data collection and formatting

### Run Benchmarks
- [ ] Execute benchmarks for each selected model
- [ ] Collect performance data
- [ ] Verify benchmark consistency
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### Analyze Results
- [ ] Process collected benchmark data
- [ ] Generate comparative statistics
- [ ] Create visualizations of performance differences
- [ ] Identify performance patterns and bottlenecks

### Present Findings
- [ ] Compile comprehensive benchmark report
- [ ] Summarize key findings and insights
- [ ] Provide recommendations for optimal model selection
- [ ] Document methodology for reproducibility
