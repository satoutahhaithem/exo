# LLM Benchmarking Methodology for Exo-Lab

This document outlines the methodology and metrics used for benchmarking different LLM models within the same node using the exo-lab clustering service.

## Benchmarking Metrics

The following metrics will be collected for each model:

### 1. Inference Latency

Definition: The total time taken from submitting a prompt to receiving the complete response.

Measurement: Measured in seconds, from the start of encoding the prompt to the completion of decoding the response.

Significance: Lower latency indicates faster response time, which is critical for interactive applications.

### 2. Memory Usage

Definition: The additional memory consumed during model inference.

Measurement: Measured in megabytes (MB), calculated as the difference between memory usage before and after model inference.

Significance: Lower memory usage allows for more efficient resource utilization and potentially running larger models or multiple models simultaneously.

### 3. Tokens Per Second (TPS)

Definition: The rate at which the model can generate output tokens.

Measurement: Calculated by dividing the number of output tokens by the total inference time.

Significance: Higher TPS indicates better throughput, which is important for batch processing or handling multiple requests.

## Test Prompts

To ensure consistent and comprehensive evaluation, the following standardized prompts will be used:

1. "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in simple terms."
   - Tests general knowledge and explanation capabilities

2. "Write a short poem about technology."
   - Tests creative generation capabilities

3. "Summarize the key benefits of renewable energy."
   - Tests summarization and domain knowledge

4. "What are the main differences between classical and quantum computing?"
   - Tests technical explanation and comparative analysis

5. "Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants."
   - Tests scientific explanation capabilities

These prompts cover a range of tasks and domains to provide a well-rounded assessment of model performance.

## Testing Environment

All benchmarks will be run on the same node with the following specifications:

- Hardware: Same physical machine for all tests
- Software: Exo framework with appropriate inference engine (tinygrad or MLX)
- Configuration: Default model settings with temperature=0.0 for deterministic output
- Isolation: No other resource-intensive processes running during benchmarking

## Testing Procedure

1. Preparation:
   - Install exo and dependencies
   - Download all models before benchmarking to eliminate download time from measurements

2. Execution:
   - Run each model with each prompt
   - Measure latency, memory usage, and calculate TPS
   - Record all metrics and model outputs

3. Analysis:
   - Calculate average metrics across all prompts for each model
   - Generate visualizations comparing model performance
   - Identify performance patterns and bottlenecks

## Reproducibility

To ensure reproducibility of results:

- Fixed random seeds will be used where applicable
- Multiple runs will be performed and averaged
- All environment variables and configuration settings will be documented
- The same hardware and software environment will be used for all tests

## Limitations

This benchmarking methodology has the following limitations:

- Results are specific to the hardware and software configuration used
- Performance may vary with different prompts or workloads
- Quality of model outputs is not evaluated, only performance metrics
- The methodology focuses on single-node performance, not distributed inference

These limitations should be considered when interpreting the benchmark results.
